# Text Classification

This repository provides an exploration of various machine learning and clustering models on text data. Our aim is to understand and compare the performance of these algorithms when applied to natural language processing tasks.

## Overview

We've used the following models to classify our text dataset:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective model that is often used as a baseline for text classification problems. It models the probability of a certain class or event based on one or more predictor variables.
  
- **Naive Bayes**: Based on the Bayes theorem, this algorithm is particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets, which makes it a popular choice for text classification tasks.
  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: SVMs are used for both regression and classification problems. For our text data, it works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.
  
- **Decision Trees**: A flowchart-like model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It makes decisions based on asking a series of questions.
  
- **KMeans Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data based on attributes into K number of sets. It's useful for exploring data and understanding patterns.
  
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: A type of hierarchical clustering that builds nested clusters by merging or splitting them successively.

## Installation and Setup

Ensure you have a working Python environment. Dependencies and setup instructions are provided within the repository.

## Usage

You can run each model separately. For best results, ensure your data is preprocessed appropriately before input into the model. Each model script contains detailed comments and guidelines for usage.

## Results and Analysis

Each model's performance varies based on the nature and distribution of the dataset. It's recommended to visualize and evaluate results comprehensively. We've provided an evaluation module for easy comparison of model outputs.
